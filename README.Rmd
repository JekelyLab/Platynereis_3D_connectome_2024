## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

If you would like to use the template, you could open Rstudio in your computer, then go to File > New Project > Version Control > Git. Under repository URL add the URL of this page https://github.com/JekelyLab/Platynereis_3D_connectome_2024 and save it in a local folder.

The R project will live in the folder (as working directory) where the Jekely_et_al_2024_connectome.Rproj file is saved. All other files and directories will be accessed relative to this working directory. This way the project is portable and self-contained.

The working directory contains this README file, a LICENCE file, a CITATION.cff file, the .gitignore file and the R project file. You can update these files to fit your project.
